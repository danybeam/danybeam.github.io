# Welcome to my personal Github pages page
This is intended as the central hub of all projects I intend to make somewhat public
I'll be taking the 100 dyas of code challenge starting on January 5th so stay tuned

## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2018

### Day 1: January 5. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on time units and ticker classes

**Thoughts:** Feels good to try to get a head start for the semester but it's hard to get back to work

### Day 2: January 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished TimeUnit tests and started working on ticker

**Thoughts:** I'm already starting to get insecure, mostly because of my thread handling
I'm sure it will pass, I don't feel THAT bad, just like riding a bike after a while

### Day 3: January 7. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 2 of "Python Facil"

**Thoughts:** I wasn't feeling it today, but this challenge is about self discipline
Both in terms of doing constant work and learning to let go of things... at least for me.
Even if today wasn't a great day I still feel very good about the challenge

**Link to work:** I practiced offline this time but here is the book and a couple of photos of todays work

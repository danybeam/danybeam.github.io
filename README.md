# Welcome to my personal Github pages page
This is intended as the central hub of all projects I intend to make somewhat public
I'll be taking the 100 dyas of code challenge starting on January 5th so stay tuned

## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2018

### Day 1: January 5. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on time units and ticker classes

**Thoughts:** Feels good to try to get a head start for the semester but it's hard to get back to work

### Day 2: January 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished TimeUnit tests and started working on ticker

**Thoughts:** I'm already starting to get insecure, mostly because of my thread handling
I'm sure it will pass, I don't feel THAT bad, just like riding a bike after a while

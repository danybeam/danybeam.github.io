# Welcome to my personal Github pages page
This is intended as the central hub of all projects I intend to make somewhat public
I'll be taking the 100 dyas of code challenge starting on January 5th so stay tuned

## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2018

### Day 1: January 5. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on time units and ticker classes

**Thoughts:** Feels good to try to get a head start for the semester but it's hard to get back to work

### Day 2: January 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished TimeUnit tests and started working on ticker

**Thoughts:** I'm already starting to get insecure, mostly because of my thread handling
I'm sure it will pass, I don't feel THAT bad, just like riding a bike after a while

### Day 3: January 7. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 2 of "Python Facil"

**Thoughts:** I wasn't feeling it today, but this challenge is about self discipline
Both in terms of doing constant work and learning to let go of things... at least for me.
Even if today wasn't a great day I still feel very good about the challenge

**Link to work:** I practiced offline this time but here is the book and a couple of photos of todays work

### Day 4: January 8. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 2 exercises of "Python Facil" and started chapter 3

**Thoughts:** I selpt all day so starting was particularly dificult today  
Even if yesterday was hard today was not only mentally hard but also physically
I loved using "yield" I don't know what I want it for yet but it's still awesome

* messing around with diamond inheritance (result was 'c' by the way) ![Proof of Work 4](https://github.com/danybeam/danybeam.github.io/blob/master/100DaysOfCode/R1/Day%204/R1D4%20proof%20of%20work%204%20-%20python.PNG)

### Day 5: January 10. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished reading Chapter 3 of "Python Facil" and started chapter 3 exercises

**Thoughts:** I started reading the book because I wasn't on the right mood for my project on day 3 but now I feel like it's snowballing, there are some things I find a bit wierd in Python, but it's a very generous language and it's pretty easy to maipulate I hope I can start a project on Python soon.

### Day 6: January 11. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter 3 excersice 1 (skipped the rest) and started reading chapter 4

**Thoughts:** Slow day but chapter 3 excersices where kind of a drag with little to no benefit to someone that already knows to programm and chapter 4 is getting deep with matrixes so I'm focusing more on the code or on the theory

**Link to work:**
* [Pyhton Facil](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Python-f%C3%A1cil-Arnaldo-Perez-Casta%C3%B1o/dp/8426722121/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1515371081&sr=8-2&keywords=python+facil)
* End of exercise 1 of chapter 3 is just adding some attributes and the apropiate getters/setters

### Day 7: January 12. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter 4 and excersices 2 and 3 and started chapter 5

**Thoughts:** Honestly some excersices while VERY academic and formative are a big middle finger to someone that is learning  
There are some path finding algorithms that are asked as if it weren't a biggie, 
wich I admit they ultimately aren't for a seasoned programmer 
but if you're still learning the language (like me) or starting to learn programming itself (like the intended audience)
it's kinda daunting

### Day 8: January 13. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Still on chapter 5, messed around with the concept of wrappers and meta clases

**Thoughts:** nothing much to say today, I did conscious learning but at the same time I was kinda on autopilot

* [Pyhton Facil](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Python-f%C3%A1cil-Arnaldo-Perez-Casta%C3%B1o/dp/8426722121/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1515371081&sr=8-2&keywords=python+facil)
* Memoize wrapper ![memoize](https://github.com/danybeam/danybeam.github.io/blob/master/100DaysOfCode/R1/Day%208/R1D8%20proof%20of%20work%201%20-%20python.PNG)

### Day 9: January 14. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter 5 and started chapter 6

**Thoughts:** Woke up hangover as hell but discipline is still discipline
The more I read the more I ask myself why there isn't a universal language 
that everybody can use regardless of the machine or the purpouse
I know Java has it's flaws but the portability is what draw me to it
and that's what first draw me to python, if I find a good/easy to use GUI package on python I might never come back (for hobby things)

* no pertinent code today :/

### Day 10: January 15. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Investigated how to make an .exe file (not much success)

**Thoughts:** I don't know why I chosed the day my internet conection was at it's work to start doing RESEARCH but it was too string of an itch, might continue tomorrow

**Link to work:** For privacy (and porn) reasons I won't be sharing my browsing hystory thanks for your comprehension

### Day 11: January 16. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter 6 and started the final chapter :D

**Thoughts:** I didn't continue, my conection is still crappy but I'm almost finished with the Python book, wich is nice... REALLY NICE actually

**Link to work:** 
* [Pyhton Facil](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Python-f%C3%A1cil-Arnaldo-Perez-Casta%C3%B1o/dp/8426722121/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1515371081&sr=8-2&keywords=python+facil)
* Only reading today

### Day 12: January 18. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with threads on python, mostly to learn how they operate
posted a serious question on reddit "what makes a 'good' programming language?"
Made a distraction/wouldn't it be nice if_ list on wunderlist because This rabitt hole is WAY too deep

**Thoughts:** I almost missed two days in a row, worst part is it wasn't because of lazyness, more like forgetfullness
anyways, looks like balancing 100DoC and school isn't going to be as easy as I tought, but it doesn't look imposible... for now

### Day 13: January 19. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued chapter 7, not great advance since they explained red and black trees with "pictures" on a black and white book
**Thoughts:** I don't know if the autor knew they where going to print it on a black and white book but explaining colors with black and white pictures was a stupid idea

### Day 14: January 21. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished that book
**Thoughts:** It has been ages since I finished a book (because of pleasure) I know I didn't become a god in Python or anything but for I feel confident enough for hobby projects and I might actually migrate to it so I can dig up some more

### Day 15: January 22. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Investigated what is a red black tree and why we define functions inside of functions in python
**Thoughts:** I'm filling up the gaps the book left so I can move more confidently in python, but while syntax is a little weird it's still not that hard, actually
**Link to work:**

### Day 16: January 23. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Investigated why pthon 3 exists and why it became so disruptive, what are dotfiles, and how semantic versioning works
**Thoughts:** I'm starting to feel bad that I'm not actually writing lines of code anymore but I really feel I need to finish investigating before trying to mess around with code in my "100 days of code to do list" I'm almost done with investigation after that is done I promise lines will start flowing... or at least appearing
**Link to work:** 
* [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
* [Python 2 or 3?](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3)

### Day 17: January 24. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned (read, deleted) my repositories and started reading about legality of open source software and contributing guidelines
**Thoughts:** this took longer than I expected abd will keep being longer for a while but chipping it bit by bit seems like a good strategy for now

* [Licensing a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/)
* [Creating releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)

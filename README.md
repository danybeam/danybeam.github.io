# Welcome to my personal Github pages page
This is intended as the central hub of all projects I intend to make somewhat public
I'll be taking the 100 dyas of code challenge starting on January 5th so stay tuned

## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2018

### Day 1: January 5. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on time units and ticker classes

**Thoughts:** Feels good to try to get a head start for the semester but it's hard to get back to work

### Day 2: January 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished TimeUnit tests and started working on ticker

**Thoughts:** I'm already starting to get insecure, mostly because of my thread handling
I'm sure it will pass, I don't feel THAT bad, just like riding a bike after a while

### Day 3: January 7. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 2 of "Python Facil"

**Thoughts:** I wasn't feeling it today, but this challenge is about self discipline
Both in terms of doing constant work and learning to let go of things... at least for me.
Even if today wasn't a great day I still feel very good about the challenge

**Link to work:** I practiced offline this time but here is the book and a couple of photos of todays work

* Getting familiarized with objects in Python ![Proof of Work 1](https://github.com/danybeam/danybeam.github.io/blob/master/100DaysOfCode/R1/Day%203/R1D3%20proof%20of%20work%201%20-%20python.PNG)
* Doing some excercises from the book ![Proof of Work 2](https://github.com/danybeam/danybeam.github.io/blob/master/100DaysOfCode/R1/Day%203/R1D3%20proof%20of%20work%202%20-%20python.PNG)

### Day 4: January 8. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 2 exercises of "Python Facil" and started chapter 3

**Thoughts:** I selpt all day so starting was particularly dificult today  
Even if yesterday was hard today was not only mentally hard but also physically
I loved using "yield" I don't know what I want it for yet but it's still awesome

* Exercise 1 ![Proof of Work 1](https://github.com/danybeam/danybeam.github.io/blob/master/100DaysOfCode/R1/Day%204/R1D4%20proof%20of%20work%201%20-%20python.PNG)
* exercise 2 ![Proof of Work 2](https://github.com/danybeam/danybeam.github.io/blob/master/100DaysOfCode/R1/Day%204/R1D4%20proof%20of%20work%202%20-%20python.PNG)

* messing around with diamond inheritance (result was 'c' by the way) ![Proof of Work 4](https://github.com/danybeam/danybeam.github.io/blob/master/100DaysOfCode/R1/Day%204/R1D4%20proof%20of%20work%204%20-%20python.PNG)


### January 9. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I had to take care of somme school stuff and completely forgot to work today

**Thoughts:** Honestly I'm ashamed I had to take a day of so quickly  
I had to re-sign up for a class because it was full when I first made my semester schedule  
and the guy that was going to be my partner couldn't make it to the same group so I was kind of sad and that made me derail a little  
but this is abouit discipline and oficial rules state that missing a day is not failing if you add an extra day at the end  
Which is totally cool because I was planning to anyways

**Commitment:** I hereby commit to work an aditional day to make up for today
